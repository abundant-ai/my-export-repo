I will create a command-line tool called `api-change-guard` to compare two OpenAPI specifications and identify breaking changes. The tool will be written in Python and installed at `/usr/local/bin/api-change-guard`.

First, I'll write the Python script for the tool.Now, I'll create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the `PyYAML` dependency.
Next, I'll install the dependency using `pip`. This command will install the `PyYAML` package listed in the 
`requirements.txt` file.Now that the dependencies are installed, I'll move the script to `/usr/local/bin/` to make it accessible as
pgrep: bash: line 1: pgrep: command not found
a command-line tool and then make it executable. This command moves the script.Now, I'll make the `api-change-guard` command executable. This allows the script to be run directly from the
pgrep: bash: line 1: pgrep: command not found
terminal.The `api-change-guard` CLI tool is now installed and ready to use. I have completed all the steps
pgrep: bash: line 1: pgrep: command not found
to set it up.
